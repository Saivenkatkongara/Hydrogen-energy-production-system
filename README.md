## Overview
This repository houses my contributions to MathWorks' Excellence in Innovation [Project 204](https://github.com/mathworks/MathWorks-Excellence-in-Innovation/tree/main/projects/Green%20Hydrogen%20Production), as part of my MSc in Automation and Systems Engineering at the Federal University of Santa Catarina. The project focuses on the development of a DC microgrid integrating a regenerative fuel cell with a photovoltaic panel.

## Project Description
The system is designed to explore the feasibility and efficiency of green hydrogen production. Detailed modeling of the components is available in `report.mlx`. To simulate the microgrid's behavior and performance, open the `microgrid.slx` file.
