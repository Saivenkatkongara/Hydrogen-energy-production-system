## Overview
This repository houses my contributions to MathWorks' Excellence in Innovation [Project 204](https://github.com/mathworks/MathWorks-Excellence-in-Innovation/tree/main/projects/Green%20Hydrogen%20Production), as part of my MSc in Automation and Systems Engineering at the Federal University of Santa Catarina. The project focuses on the development of a DC microgrid integrating a regenerative fuel cell with a photovoltaic panel.

## Project Description
The project delves into the feasibility and efficiency of green hydrogen as a sustainable energy storage solution in microgrids. It includes detailed modeling of key components documented in `report.mlx` for in-depth understanding and provides a `microgrid.slx` file for simulation to analyze the system's behavior and performance, thus fostering advancements in sustainable energy practices.
